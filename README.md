Chikitsahayaka as the name suggests, is chikitsa + sahayaka meaning medical assistant. It focuses on resolving high frequency low complexity queries. This bot comprises of 3 layers i.e. speech to text, text query resolution and text to speech.
For text query resolution I have used chatgpt. Focus of this bot is to give immediate first aid instruction, contact hospital and reroute higher queries there.

To run this app, make sure you install streamlit.
after streamlit installation, open the terminal and enter streamlit run app.py
app.py is where the python prototype is made. 

Thanks for viewing my product. Have a nice day!
